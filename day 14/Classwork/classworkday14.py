# We need to create a program where the user will input the number of repetitions and how many 
# numbers he wants to input, after that we run input as many times in the 
# for loop and find out what numbers will be input and the sum of those numbers.

# count_numbers = int(input("Please enter how many numbers do you want to input: "))

# sum_numbers = 0

# for i in range(1, count_numbers + 1):
#     user_num = int(input("Please enter number " + str(i) + ": "))
#     sum_numbers = sum_numbers + user_num
