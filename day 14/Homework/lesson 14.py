# We should take a look at the w3 school site about for loops and create our own 5 for loops for different purposes.

# brothers = ["Nikolozi", "Giorgi", "Joni"]
# for x in brothers:

# for x in "Nikolozi":

# for x in items:
#   if x == "Physics":
#     break
#   print(x)

# for x in range(6):
#   print(x)

# While Loops

# i = 1
