    <h1>Zaqaria Phaliashvili</h1>
<h2>An genius Composer</h2>
<hr>
<p1>
    Zakaria Paliashvili, born on August 16, 1871, in Kutaisi, Georgia, was a pioneering Georgian composer, conductor, and teacher. He is best known for his foundational role in Georgian classical music. Paliashvili's musical journey began early; he joined the Georgian Catholic Church choir as a child and learned to play the organ. In 1887, he moved to Tbilisi and became involved in the Georgian Ethnographic Choir, which greatly influenced his musical development.

    He studied at the Tbilisi Music School and later at the Moscow Conservatory under Sergei Taneyev, a renowned composer and teacher. Upon returning to Georgia, Paliashvili took on significant roles in the Georgian musical community, founding choirs and orchestras and teaching at the Tbilisi Music School.
    
    Paliashvili dedicated much of his career to incorporating Georgian folk music into classical compositions. He conducted extensive ethnomusicological fieldwork, collecting and transcribing over 300 folk songs. This work deeply influenced his compositions, such as the operas "Abesalom and Eteri" and "Daisi." "Abesalom and Eteri," based on a medieval Georgian poem, premiered in 1919 and is considered a cornerstone of Georgian national opera.
    
    Throughout his life, Paliashvili's contributions to Georgian music were widely recognized. He was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR, among other honors. Zakaria Paliashvili passed away on October 6, 1933, in Tbilisi, leaving a lasting legacy in the world of music. His work remains a vital part of Georgian cultural heritage.</p1>
